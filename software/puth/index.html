<h1>put-homepages</h1>
    
<p>put-homepages is a short Perl script for automatically updating
    fines on a remote FTP server to match a local archive. In its
    current incarntion it's designed for Demon Internet users
    maintaining the Web pages served under Demon's "homepages"
    service, but it could probably be turned to some more general
    tasks.</p>

    
<p>In its current form, it is <em>not</em> suitable for use by
    people who want a packaged-and-ready solution; don't download
    it unless you hack Perl, since you'll almost certainly find
    yourself hacking the source to make it do what you want.
    However, if you do hack Perl, you might find it very useful for
    maintaining your Web pages just as I do, and if you submit your
    improvements to me we can make it more generally useful. I plan
    to release it under the GPL, but if you need a more liberal
    license let me know, I'm pretty likely to be amenable.</p>

    
<p>Since writing this, I've been informed of two packages that do
    similar jobs, <a href="http://sunsite.org.uk/packages/mirror/">
    mirror</a> and <a href="http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/">
    sitecopy</a>. Mirror has an irritating, barely-OSD "patch"
    license; sitecopy is GPL. I didn't know about sitecopy when I
    started writing this, and it may turn out to be an all-round
    better solution.  I can now use rsync to update my website anyway,
    so I don't use this any more.</p>

    
<p>Unsurprisingly, documentation is weak to nonexistant; if
    some of the source is incomprehensible then feel free to ask.
    Some facts about the script in random order:</p>

    
<ul>
      
<li>It keeps a copy of the current state of the FTP site in a
      separate directory, and compares the current to the desired
      state before connecting to the FTP server to compose a plan
      of how to update the site. When it connects, it checks that
      its local copy of the state is sufficiently accurate before
      proceeding.</li>

      
<li>It uses a parser for "ls -lR" output to read the state of
      directory trees; this is particularly efficient when querying
      the remote site, but should do a reasonable job of the local
      side too, and keeps everything consistent.</li>

      
<li>It will create and delete directories and files as well
      as updating file contents to keep the two sides consistent.
      However, it doesn't understand about renaming files - it will
      delete the old name and upload to the new name.</li>

      
<li>Where it finds files present remotely that are not in its
      record of the current state, it fetches those files, unless
      the file it fetched last time appears to be up-to-date. The
      upshot of this for Demon Internet users is that it will fetch
      "bwusage.txt" whenever it changes.</li>

      
<li>It can be configured to retrieve the latest version of
      your homepages from a repository of the marvellously clean
      and straightforward revision control system <a href="http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~jmacd/prcs.html">PRCS</a>
      before updating the remote site - when used in this way, it
      ignores files present in the "new" directory that PRCS
      disclaims.</li>

      
<li>It expects to find all the files it's going to use to
      have specific, fixed names in a configuration directory:
      "current" for its record of the current state of the archive,
      "new" for the desired state, "password" for the password to
      use on the remote FTP server, "extras" for uploading
      unexpected remote files, "remote-state" for a directory
      listing of the remote end potentially useful for diagnosing
      inconsistencies, and "PRCS" for the PRCS repository.</li>

      
<li>It actually has quite a few command-line options which
      even have a little documentation.</li>
    
</ul>

    
<p>I strongly recommend using the PRCS functionality of this
    script even if you use PRCS for nothing else; it's very simple
    to learn and does all the right things for this job. Here's how
    I currently use this script: I've created a user "homepgs"
    especially to manage it, and the configuration directory is
    simply "/home/homepgs". My dialout scripts include the
    equivalent of "su -c /home/homepgs/scripts/put-homepages
    homepgs", so every time I dial out, the homepgs user checks out
    the latest version of the home pages from PRCS, and if
    necessary updates the remote FTP site. I have a local copy of
    the pages in my home directory which I can edit freely, and I
    check it in when it's ready for release and simply wait for the
    next dialout from cron. Of course, PRCS is designed to handle
    multiple users working on the same archive with grace.</p>

    
<p>Remember: read and understand this script before you try
    and use it. But if you do, please let me know!</p>
