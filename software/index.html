      Software</p>
<h1>Software</h1>
    
<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> None of this software is packaged for
    release. Don't bother fetching it unless you like reading and
    fixing other people's code.</p>

    
<p>I've discovered that if I put off making a piece of software
    available for download until I've created a package that's in a
    state in which someone could fetch it and use it without reading
    and modifying the source, then I'll be putting it off forever. So
    I put it here in the hope that (a) it will be useful to those who
    understand it, and (b) that someone might volunteer to help me
    create a more generally useful package. Most of it is in Perl and
    requires Perl 5. Most of it is left uncompressed - it's easier to
    view online that way, and it's so small it's hardly worth the
    bother.</p>

    
<p>With the above warning in mind, please feel free to <a href="mailto:software@ciphergoth.org">mail me</a> with any
    questions or problems with any of this software.</p>

<dd>A Perl script that makes maintaining a remote website of

<dd>dials your ISP and runs a bunch of services when you

      up, then emits sh directives to do the same work.</dd>
