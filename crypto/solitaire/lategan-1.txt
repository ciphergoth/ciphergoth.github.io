Interesting observation!  However, it needs to be modified slightly.
The "count cut" can come between the two jokers, meaning that the
position of the two jokers is swapped; if it was x before, it will be
54-x afterwards.  To get around this, we can define distance to mean
the minimum distance going either in the middle of the pack or "around
the outside"; in other words, we measure it as min(x, 54-x).  This
measure of distance is unchanged by the count cut, and will change by
1 (either up or down) with very high probability each round.

This is the first time I've heard this fascinating observation.  When
I get time, I'll add this to my Solitaire page and credit you.  Thanks!
