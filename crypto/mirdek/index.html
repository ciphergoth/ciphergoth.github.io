<h1>Mirdek: a card cipher inspired by "Solitaire"</h1>
    
<p>
<a href="../solitaire/">Problems with Bruce Schneier's
    "Solitaire"</a> describes a bias in the output of the card
    cipher "Solitaire". Here I'll try and describe an alternative
    cipher of my own design, "Mirdek", that avoids these
    problems.</p>

    
<p>
<strong>Updated 2001.04.07</strong>: Hello to visitors from
    EAWorlds! I notice from my referrer log that <a href="http://eaworlds.boards.ea.com/messages?14@@.eef3fd2!ticket=15217563e72144f33&decode=602">
     a message on this page</a> (scroll down) is bringing lots of
    hits to this page. Please feel free to mail me with any
    questions this stuff raises. Note that the "Solitaire" cipher
    is the one linked above; this page is about my own (so far
    unsuccessful) attempts to design a secure alternative.</p>

    
<p>Now, would someone mind telling me what the hell "Majestic"
    is about? :-)</p>

    
<p>
<strong>Updated 2000.01.27: This cipher is not
    secure</strong>: it's terrifically weak against a chosen
    plaintext attack. I hope to detail these weaknesses in a future
    revision of these pages, and hopefully propose a stronger
    variant.</p>

    
<p>
<strong>Updated 2000.01.13</strong>: I've made many changes
    since the original version was published here which I hope are
    improvements. They certainly make the cipher easier to remember
    and to operate, but I hope that they also improve security. Be
    warned that there may yet be further changes - this is still a
    "work in progress".</p>

<h2>About Mirdek</h2>

    
<p>Mirdek is intended to fulfill exactly the same goals as Bruce
    Schneier's card cipher <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/solitaire.html">Solitaire</a>: a
    cipher that can be operated entirely by hand, but that resists
    machine cryptanalysis even from very well-funded adversaries. See
    <a href="http://home.ecn.ab.ca/~jsavard/crypto/pp0105.htm">John
    Savard's proposal</a> for another example.</p>

    
<h3>Strengths</h3>

    
<ul>
      
<li>No Solitaire-like bias</li>

      
<li>Use of IV drawn from shuffling means passphrase can be
      used many times</li>

      
<li>Very easy operation by comparison to other proposals - no
      mental arithmetic is required, only card counting and
      matching</li>

      
<li>Relatively fast - practical even for short messages</li>

      
<li>Easy to learn</li>

      
<li>No jokers are needed</li>
    
</ul>

    
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

    
<ul>
      
<li>The cipher is very vulnerable to a side channel attack
      using a listening device</li>

      
<li>Distinctive deck arrangement must be hidden if the use of
      encryption is to be kept secret.</li>

      
<li>IV makes ciphertext 26 characters longer than
      plaintext</li>

      
<li>Plaintext feedback (rather than pure RNG operation) makes
      analysis harder</li>

      
<li>State space limited to (26!)^2 ~= 2^177 rather than
      Solitaire's 54! ~= 2^237</li>

      
<li>New and unproven</li>
    
</ul>
