     Introduction</h1>

    <p>Disk sector encryption is an attractive approach to
    filesystem confidentiality. Filesystems access hard drive
    partitions at the granularity of the sector (or block) where a
    sector is typically 4096 bits: read and write requests are
    expressed in sector numbers, and data is read and modified a
    sector at at a time. Disk sector encryption systems present a
    ``virtual partition'' to the filesystem, mapping each sector of
    the virtual partition to the corresponding sector, through an
    encrypting transformation, on a physical disk partition with
    the same disk geometry. The performance is typically better
    than file-level encryption schemes, since every logical sector
    read or write results in exactly one physical sector read or
    write, and confidentiality is also better: not only are file
    contents obscured, but also filenames, file sizes, directory
    structure and modification dates. These schemes are also
    flexible since they make no special assumptions about the way
    the filesystem stores the file data; they work equally well
    with raw database partitions as with filesystems, and can be
    transparently layered underneath disk caching and disk
    compression schemes. Linux provides some support for such
    filesystems through the ``/dev/loop0'' filesystem device.</p>

    <p>The stream cipher SEAL [<a href="bibliography.html#seal" shape="rect">17</a>] is well suited to this
    need. SEAL provides a strong cryptographic PRNG (CPRNG) whose
    output is seekable. Thus the entire disk can be treated as a
    single contiguous array of bytes and XORred with the output
    from the CPRNG; when making reads or writes of specific sectors
    the appropriate portion of the output can be generated without
    the need to generate the preceding bytes. The same effect can
    be achieved, somewhat less efficiently, by keying a CPRNG such
    as ARCFOUR [<a href="bibliography.html#rc4" shape="rect">10</a>] with a
    (key, sector number) pair and generating 512 bytes with which
    to encrypt the sector. These schemes are highly efficient and
    provide good security against an attacker who seizes an
    encrypted hard drive and attempts to gain information about its
    contents.</p>

    <p>However, this is not strong against attackers with other
    channels open to them. They may have user privileges on the
    system they're trying to attack, and be able to access the
    ciphertext stored on the hard drive at times when it's shut
    down. Or they may try to modify sectors with known contents
    while carrying a drive from place to place. They may even be
    able to place hardware probes on the drive chain while logged
    in as a normal user, and sniff or modify ciphertext. Against
    these attacks, SEAL and ARCFOUR (used as described) are
    ineffective. For example, an attacker can write a large file of
    all zeroes and thereby find the fixed encryption stream
    associated with many sectors; once the file is deleted, the
    sectors might be re-used by other users with secure data to
    write, and this data is easily decrypted by XORing with the
    known stream. Or, if attackers can make a guess of the
    plaintext in a given sector, they can modify this to another
    plaintext of their choosing while they have access to the drive
    by XORing the ciphertext with the XOR difference between the
    two plaintexts.</p>

    <p>File-based encryption schemes defeat these attacks by using
    a new random IV for each new plaintext and authenticating with
    a MAC. However, applying these techniques directly to sector
    encryption would require that the ciphertext for each sector be
    larger than the plaintext, typically by at least 64 bytes. Thus
    either the plaintext sectors would need to be slightly smaller
    than the natural hardware sector size, harming performance when
    mapping files into memory (and necessitating a thorough
    re-engineering of the filesystem code) or auxiliary information
    would have to be stored in other sectors, potentially adding a
    seek to each read and write. In either case the size overhead
    will be about 1.5 - 3.1%. It's worth investigating what can be
    achieved without incurring these penalties.</p>

    <p>SFS [<a href="bibliography.html#sfs" shape="rect">9</a>] uses a keyless
    mixing transformation on the plaintext before applying a block
    chaining stream cipher. This greatly reduces the practical
    usefulness of many such attacks, but it falls short of the
    highest security that pure disk sector encryption systems can
    aspire to: that the mapping between each virtual and physical
    disk sector appears to be an independent random permutation to
    an attacker who expends insufficient computation to
    exhaustively search the keyspace. In other words, the
    theoretical best solution under these constraints is a strong
    randomised large block cipher.</p>

    <p>Several proposals exist for building large block ciphers
    from standard cryptographic components such as hash functions
    and stream ciphers [<a href="bibliography.html#bearlion" shape="rect">1</a>,<a href="bibliography.html#beast" shape="rect">11</a>,<a href="bibliography.html#onvariable" shape="rect">2</a>]; however, these are
    not randomised ciphers, and as Section <a href="avalanche_and_certif.html#sec:collision" shape="rect">2</a> shows,
    they have certificational weaknesses. More seriously, no
    proposal comes close to offering the performance needed: bit
    rates equal to or better than disk transfer rates. Since small
    improvements in disk access efficiency can mean big
    improvements to every part of the user experience, and since
    performance considerations are one of the main reasons why
    filesystem encryption is not more widely used, it seems
    worthwhile to develop a new cipher designed specifically to
    meet this need.</p>

    <p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section <a href="avalanche_and_certif.html#sec:collision" shape="rect">2</a> describes
    a certificational weakness applicable to several existing
    classes of large block cipher, and proposes a quantitiative
    measure of avalanche based on the attack. Section <a href="mercy_design_goals.html#sec:designgoals" shape="rect">3</a> lays out
    the design goals for the solution here, a new block cipher
    Mercy with a native block size of 4096 bits, and Section <a href="description_of_mercy.html#sec:mercyspec" shape="rect">4</a> describes
    the cipher itself. Section <a href="design_of_mercy.html#sec:design" shape="rect">5</a> discusses the
    design of the cipher in detail with reference to the
    performance and security goals of Section <a href="mercy_design_goals.html#sec:designgoals" shape="rect">3</a>. Finally
    Section <a href="conclusions.html#sec:conclusions" shape="rect">6</a>
    discusses some of the lessons learned in the design of
    Mercy.</p>
