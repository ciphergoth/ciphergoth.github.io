<h1>Mercy: sample source code</h1>
    
<p> This implementation of Mercy should be in pure ANSI C, but
    the timing harness is Unix-specific; code for other operating
    systems to do the same work would be welcome. It achieves just
    under 9 cycles per byte on most systems I've tried it on.</p>

    
<p> The version implemented here is that described in the <a href="./">proceedings</a> for FSE 2000; I refer to it as
    Mercy-6. I announced the first version of this algorithm on
    17th August on sci.crypt.research. Unfortunately there was a
    bug in the example source code posted that weakened the
    algorithm, so to avoid ambiguity I called the corrected version
    "Mercy-2". Various incremental revisions were made for Mercy-3
    and Mercy-4. After Mercy-4, I decided the cipher needed to be
    much simpler, easier to analyse, and needed to carry more state
    between blocks, and made several major revisions to create
    Mercy-5. When the paper was accepted I went back, realised I
    had missed out some easy improvements, and made a couple of
    very minor tweaks to create Mercy-6.</p>

    
<p> Scott Fluhrer found a bug in the RC4 implementation used in
    the key schedule; this bug is fixed here.</p>

    
<p> Since Mercy-6 has been <a href="fluhrer-dc.html">
    broken</a>, there may be another revision, but I'm not sure if
    it'll be called Mercy.</p>
