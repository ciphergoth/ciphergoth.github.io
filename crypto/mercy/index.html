<p class="abstract">
<strong>Abstract.</strong> We discuss the
    special requirements imposed on the underlying cipher of systems
    which encrypt each sector of a disk partition independently, and
    demonstrate a certificational weakness in some existing block
    ciphers including Bellare and Rogaway's 1999 proposal, proposing a
    new quantitative measure of avalanche. To address these needs, we
    present Mercy, a new block cipher accepting large (4096-bit)
    blocks, which uses a key-dependent state machine to build a
    bijective F function for a Feistel cipher.  Mercy achieves 9
    cycles/byte on a Pentium compatible processor.  <br> 
<strong>Key
    words:</strong> disk sector, large block, state machine,
    avalanche, Feistel cipher.</p>

<p>Mercy is a fast block cipher operating on 4096-bit blocks,
    designed specifically around the needs of disk sector
    encryption. It takes a 128-bit parameter representing the block
    number being encrypted, so that saving the same plaintext to
    different blocks results in different ciphertexts. Mercy was
    presented at Fast Software Encryption 2000.</p>

    
<p>
<strong>Mercy is weak</strong>: a highly effective differential
    cryptanalysis-based distinguisher across all six rounds was
    presented by Scott Fluhrer at FSE 2001. A new version of Mercy
    resistant to this attack may be forthcoming at some point; until
    then, <strong>Mercy should definitely not see real
    use</strong>.</p>

    
<p>Mercy carries no licensing restrictions, and all the source
    code here is placed in the public domain. I know of no patent
    restrictions affecting it.</p>
