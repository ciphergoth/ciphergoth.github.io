<p>When a block cipher is converted to handle units of data
    larger than its intrinsic block size, a number of weaknesses
    can be introduced, depending on the mode of operation which is
    chosen for the block cipher. For example, if two identical
    ciphertext blocks are present in different locations in a file,
    this may be used to determine the plaintext. If we can find two
    identical blocks of ciphertext when cipher block chaining (CBC)
    is used, then we know that:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] = d( C[ i ] ) ^ C[ i-1 ]
    P[ j ] = d( C[ j ] ) ^ C[ j-1 ]
</pre>

    
<p>where C is the ciphertext, P is the plaintext, and e() and
    d() are encryption and decryption respectively. Now if C[ i ] =
    C[ j ], then d( C[ i ] ) = d( C[ j ] ), which cancel out when
    xor'd so that:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] ^ C[ i-1 ] = P[ j ] ^ C[ j-1 ]
</pre>

    
<p>or:</p>

<pre>
     P[ j ] = P[ i ] ^ C[ i-1 ] ^ C[ j-1 ]
</pre>

    
<p>Knowing C[ i ] and C[ j ] we can determine P[ i ] and P[ j
    ], and knowing either P[ i ] or P[ j ] we can determine the
    other.</p>

    
<p> Something similar holds when cipher feedback (CFB) mode is
    used, except that now the decryption operation is:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] = e( C[ i-1 ] ) ^ C[ i ]
    P[ j ] = e( C[ j-1 ] ) ^ C[ j ]
</pre>

    
<p> Now if C[ i ] = C[ j ] then e( C[ i ] ) = e( C[ j ] )
    (recall that in CFB mode the block cipher is only ever used for
    encryption), so that they again cancel out, so:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] ^ e( C[ i-1 ] ) = P[ j ] ^ e( C[ j-1 ] )
</pre>

    
<p>or:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] = P[ j ] ^ e( C[ i-1 ] ) ^ e( C[ j-1 ] )
</pre>

    
<p>In general this problem is of little consequence since the
    probability of finding two equal blocks of ciphertext when using a
    160-bit block cipher on a dataset of any practical size is
    negligible. More esoteric modes of operation such as plaintext
    feedback (PFB) and ones whose acronyms have more letters than
    Welsh place names tend to have their own special problems and
    aren't considered here.</p>

    
<p>The problem does become serious, however, in the case of
    sector-level encryption, where the initialization vector cannot be
    varied. Although the IV may be unique for each sector, it remains
    constant unless special measures such as reserving extra storage
    for sector IV's which are updated with each sector write are
    taken. If a sector is read from disk, a small change made to part
    of it (for example changing a word in a text file), and the sector
    written out to disk again, several unchanged ciphertext/plaintext
    pairs will be present, allowing the above attack to be
    applied. However, there are cases in which this can be a
    problem. For example, running a program such as a disk
    defragmenter will rewrite a large number of sectors while leaving
    the IV unchanged, allowing an opponent access to large quantities
    of XOR'd plaintext blocks simply by recording the disk contents
    before and after the defragmentation process. Normally this
    problem would be avoided by using a different IV for each
    encrypted message, but most disk systems don't have the room to
    store an entire sectors worth of data as well as the IV needed to
    en/decrypt it.</p>

    
<p> An additional disadvantage of the CFB encryption mode is
    that the data in the last block of a dataset may be altered by
    an attacker to give different plaintext without it affecting
    the rest of the block, since the altered ciphertext in the last
    block never enters the feedback loop. This type of attack
    requires that an opponent possess at least two copies of the
    ciphertext, and that they differ only in the contents of the
    last block. In this case the last ciphertext block from one
    copy can be subsituted for the last ciphertext block in the
    other copy, allowing a subtle form of message modification
    attack. In fact in combination with the previously mentioned
    weakness of CFB, an attacker can determine the XOR of the
    plaintexts in the last block and substitute an arbitrary piece
    of "encrypted" plaintext to replace the existing data.</p>

    
<p> There are several approaches to tackling this problem. The
    most simplistic one is to permute the plaintext in a
    key-dependant manner before encryption and after decryption.
    This solution is unsatisfactory as it simply shuffles the data
    around without necessarily affecting any particular plaintext
    or ciphertext block. The desired goal of a change in any part
    of the plaintext affecting the entire dataset is not
    achieved.</p>

    
<p> A better solution is to encrypt data twice, once from front
    to back and then from back to front<a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>. The front-to-back pass propagates
    any dependencies to the back of the dataset, and the
    back-to-front pass propagates dependencies back to the front
    again. In this way a single change in any part of the plaintext
    affects the entire dataset. The disadvantage of this approach
    is that it at least halves the speed of the encryption, as all
    data must be encrypted twice. If the encryption is done in
    software, this may create an unacceptable loss of throughput.
    Even with hardware assistance there is a noticeable slowdown,
    as no hardware implementations easily support backwards
    encryption, requiring the data to be reversed in software
    before the second pass is possible.</p>

    
<p> The best solution is probably to use a word-wise scrambler
    polynomial like the one used in SHA. With a block of plaintext
    P this is:</p>

<pre>
    P[ i ] ^= P[ i-K1 ] ^ P[ i-K2 ]
</pre>

    
<p> with suitable values for the constants K1 and K2. If K2 is
    chosen to be 5 (the SHA block size in words) then the initial
    values of the 5 words (which can be thought of as as P[ -5
    ]...P[ -1 ]) are simply the sectorIV. The value of K1 is
    arbitrary, SFS uses a value of 4.</p>

    
<p> This technique is used by first setting the initial values
    of the 5 words to the sectorIV. The scrambler function is then
    run over the entire data block, propagating all dependencies to
    the last 5 words in the block. These last 5 words are then used
    as the IV for the CFB encryption of the entire block. In this
    way the encryption IV depends on all the bits in the block, and
    the scrambling does a moderately good job of breaking up
    statistical patterns in the plaintext. No information is lost,
    so no randomness in the sectorIV is misplaced.</p>

    
<p> This also provides resistance to the selective-modification
    attack which allows an attacker to change selected bits in the
    last block of a CFB-encrypted dataset without damage. By
    destroying the IV used in the CFB encryption, the first block
    is completely corrupted, which is unlikely to go unnoticed.</p>

    
<p> To decrypt a dataset encrypted in this manner, the first 5
    words of ciphertext are shifted into the feedback path, and the
    remainder of the dataset is decrypted in the standard manner.
    The last 5 decrypted words are then used as the IV to decrypt
    the first encrypted block. Finally, the scrambler is run over
    the recovered plaintext to undo the changes made during the
    encryption scrambling.</p>

    
<p> The overall en/decryption process used by SFS, in the case
    of 512-byte sectors and 32-bit words (so that each sector
    contains 128 words), is:</p>

<pre>
    Encryption:

        using sectorIV[ 0 ]...sectorIV[ 4 ] as the scrambler IV
            scramble data[ 0 ]...data[ 127 ]
        using data[ 127-5 ]...data[ 127-1 ] as the encryption IV
            encrypt data[ 0 ]...data[ 127 ]

    Decryption:

        using data[ 0 ]...data[ 4 ] as the encryption IV
            decrypt data[ 5 ]...data[ 127 ]
        using data[ 127-5 ]...data[ 127-1 ] as the encryption IV
            decrypt data[ 0 ]...data[ 4 ]
        using sectorIV[ 0 ]...sectorIV[ 4 ] as the scrambler IV
            scramble data[ 0 ]...data[ 127 ]
</pre>

    
<p>where the scrambling operation is:</p>

<pre>
        data[ i ] ^= data[ i-4 ] ^ data[ i-5 ]
</pre>

    
<p>as outlined above. Note that the i-4 and i-5 th values
    referred to here are the original, scrambled values, not the
    descrambled values. The easiest way to implement this is to
    cache the last 5 scrambled values and cyclically overwrite them
    as each word in the data buffer is processed.</p>

<a id="footnote1" name="footnote1">Footnote [1]:</a> To be
    precise, you need some sort of feedback from the end of a block on
    the first encryption pass to the start of the block on the next
    encryption pass. A block can be encrypted forwards twice as long
    as the IV is wrapped back to the start of the block for the second
    encryption pass.</p>
