<h1>Generating random binary data from Geiger counters</h1>
    
<p>
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">HotBits</a> times
    the intervals between successive clicks of a Geiger counter facing
    a radioactive source, and converts those integers to random bits.
    HotBits uses a straightforward strategy for converting intervals
    to bits which produces 0.5 bits/sample.  We present here a more
    sophisticated but still appealingly simple strategy which would
    yield up to 6.25 bits/sample; the output is provably unbiased and
    uncorrelated given only the assumption that each input sample is
    independently drawn from the same distribution.</p>

    
<h2>Randomness from Geiger counters</h2>

    
<p>Everyone knows that radioactive decay is truly random: whether
    or not a given nucleus will decay in the next second is entirely
    down to chance. If it doesn't decay this second, the chances that
    it'll do so in the next are exactly the same. If it survives
    another million years, it still has the same chance of decaying in
    the second following that; it doesn't "age". For the nucleus,
    every second is a game of Russian Roulette, and there are always
    the same number of bullets in the barrel. That's why you can't
    measure the "life" of a radioactive source - instead, we measure
    the "half-life", which is the time it takes before the chances
    it'll have decayed are 1/2 - or to put it another way, the time
    before half the nuclei in a given sample have decayed.</p>

    
<h2>Strategies for a perfect particle detector</h2>

    
<p>So it's an appealing source of random numbers - place a Geiger
    counter close to a radioactive source, and the "clicks" are
    randomly distributed. If the source is large enough and has a long
    enough half life, we can ignore its slow decay, and treat each
    "click" as an independent event - the probability of a click in
    the next millisecond is the same no matter what the history
    is.</p>

    
<p>Thus, whether or not there's a click during a given millisecond
    is an independent coin flip for each millisecond.  However, it's
    the flip of a biased coin: if the source is cool, it's more likely
    to come down "tails" (no click) than "heads" (click).
    Fortunately, it's easy to turn a biased coin flip into an unbiased
    one: take the coin flips in pairs, and discard the pairs where
    both flips are the same.  Then we rule that (H,T) = 0, (T,H) = 1 -
    if the flips are independent, each of these pairs is equally
    likely no matter how biased the coin is, so the bit we get out is
    guaranteed to be fair.  This is known as the Von Neumann strategy</p>

    
<p>You can get rather more fair bits from your biased flips using
    a more sophisticated strategy.  The <a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/software/unbiasing/">Advanced
    Multi-Level Strategy</a> or <a href="http://www.ciphergoth.org/software/unbiasing/">AMLS</a> for
    short, developed by Yuval Peres, approaches a perfect way of doing
    such a conversion as the number of flips its given to process
    increases - it extracts close to every last drop of randomness
    from the flips it's given.</p>

    
<h2>Strategies for real Geiger counters</h2>

    
<p>This strategy is very close to perfection for the circumstances
    described; unfortunately, there's a snag.  The radioactive source
    may act like a nearly-perfect source of randomness, but the Geiger
    counter is an imperfect way of detecting it. Real Geiger counters
    take a while to recover after detecting each particle, so the
    probability it'll "click" during a given millisecond isn't
    constant, but depends on how long ago the last "click" was.
    Trying to model how this depends is a complex business, and an
    error in the model could mean imperfectly random output.</p>

    
<p>So from hereon in we'll make a much weaker assumption: we'll
      measure the intervals between clicks, and assume only that each
      interval is independently drawn from the same distribution.</p>

    
<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/how.html"><img src="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/figures/t1t2.gif"></a>
</p>

    
<p>HotBits uses a simpler strategy.  It takes intervals in pairs;
      if T_0 &lt; T_1, output 0, if T_0 &gt; T_1, output 1, if T_0 == T_1,
      don't output anything.  Then discard both samples and move on to
      comparing T_2 and T_3.  This is guaranteed to produce true
      random bits under the assumption above, but it produces a little
      under 0.5 bits from each sample.</p>

    
<p>If we knew the median interval, we could do a little better:
    for each interval, if T &lt; M, output 0, else output 1.  This
    produces 1 bit/sample.  However, measuring the median is an
    imprecise business like all statistical measurements, and if we
    get it wrong then our output will be biased.</p>

    
<p>AMLS solves this problem.  We can pick an arbitrary "pivot" P,
    perhaps a rough guess at the median.  Then if T &lt; P, output Heads,
    else output Tails.  This provides a sequence of coin flips that
    AMLS can use to generate truly random output, even if there's a
    bias in favour of H or T.  If P is very close to the median, we'll
    generate very close to 1 bit/sample; if P is far from the median,
    we'll still get truly random bits, but fewer of them.</p>

    
<p align="center">

<p>The very cheapest way to estimate the median is to use just one
      sample, the first in the sequence.</p>

    
<p align="center">

<h2>Better than 1 bit/sample</h2>

    
<p>To get better than 1 bit/sample we use a strategy inspired by
    Quicksort, and based on the following observation.  Take a
    sequence of samples independently drawn from the same unknown
    distribution.  Discard all those less than (or greater than) some
    arbitrary M.  What we're left with is a (perhaps) shorter sequence
    with just the same property - all the samples are drawn
    independently from the same distribution.</p>

    
<p>So we can apply the strategy above recursively.  Break the
    sequence of intervals into "blocks" of hundreds to thousands of
    samples each.  Pick the "pivot" P to be the first element in the
    block, and remove it from the block.  Use P to generate Heads and
    Tails as described above - but as you do so, divide the remainder
    of the block into two shorter blocks, S_0 and S_1, where S_0 is
    all the elements &lt; P and S_1 is those &gt;= P.  Use the Heads
    and Tails to generate random bits using AMLS as before.  Then
    re-run the algorithm recursively over S_0 and S_1 to generate more
    random bits from the information about the samples you haven't
    used yet.</p>

    
<p align="center">
<img src="diag2.png"></p>
    
    
<p>This works well, but it has one small problem familiar to
    Quicksort implementors.  It will sometimes happen that the
    block it comes to match will simply be copies of the same
    element over and over again.  When this happens, the algorithm
    performs very slowly, raking over the entire block over and
    over again removing one element at a time and producing no random
    bits as a result.  So it's worth making the partitioning slightly
    more sophisticated.  We partition twice: first into S_0 and S_1,
    where elements in S_0 = P and S_1 != P, generating coin flips as
    before.  We then partition S_1 into S_2 &lt; P and S_3 &gt; P, producing
    a second sequence of coin flips which we feed to a separate
    instance of AMLS.  Finally we recurse over S_2 and S_3.  With
    care, both partitions can be performed in a single pass over the
    data.  And the partition can be performed in-place, just like
    Quicksort.</p>

<p>I've implemented this strategy in C, and tested it against the
    distribution of intervals available to HotBits - a Gaussian
    distribution with mean 1889.35 and s.d. 26.4.  With 65536-sample
    blocks, it produces 6.25 bits/sample, and on my machine (400 MHz
    K6) handles 300,000 samples/second.  It is also space-efficient -
    apart from the storage of the random bits themselves, the majority
    of the auxiliary storage is used to store the block of samples
    before processing - a block size of 8192 samples requires 48K of
    storage; for a 65536 sample block, 382K is required.</p>
