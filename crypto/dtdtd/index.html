<h1>Cryptanalysis of Carl Ellison's
    des|tran|des|tran|des</h1>
    
<p> Carl Ellison proposes a large-block variant of triple-DES
    based on an unkeyed reversible mixing function, <a href="http://world.std.com/~cme/code/">tran</a>, which takes an
    8192 byte (65536-bit) input block, seeds a PRNG with a
    histogram of the bytes in the block, and shuffles the bytes
    based on the output of the PRNG using a series of swaps.
    Because the histogram is unchanged by the shuffle, the state of
    the PRNG can be reconstructed and the shuffle reversed.</p>

    
<p> This is then used to construct a form of inner chaining for
    large-block triple-DES: three ECB-mode DES encryptions of the
    65536-bit block with three different keys are interleaved with
    two unkeyed TRAN stages. This gives a 168-bit keyspace; we
    refer to Layers 1 - 5, where odd numbered layers are keyed DES
    transformations, and even numbered are unkeyed <strong>
    tran</strong> mixing layers. David Wagner <a href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/my-posts/des-tran-broken">
     proposed an attack</a> on this scheme, but it turns out that
    this attacks a variant on the scheme based on a bug in an
    implementation of <strong>tran</strong>.</p>

    
<p> However, an attack requiring around 2^71 trial DES
    encryptions is possible. Consider a plaintext chosen such that
    the input to each of the DES blocks in the Layer 1 is the same.
    Since all the outputs are the same, at most eight distinct
    bytes are available for Layer 2 <strong>tran</strong> to
    shuffle, and so there are only 8^8 possible inputs to each DES
    block in Layer 3. Since there are 2^10 actual inputs, the
    probability that two will collide is roughly 2^-5; this will
    result in two identical 64-bit blocks in the output of Layer 3,
    an event that would otherwise occur with probability around
    2^-45.</p>

    
<p> The attack proceeds as follows. First, generate 128 blocks
    of plaintext-ciphertext pairs matching the special property
    above. With probability about 0.91, at least two of these
    blocks will have collisions in the output of Layer 3, though of
    course we don't yet know which two. We find out as follows:
    take the first of the blocks and make a guess at the key for
    Layer 5; decrypt Layer 5 of the ciphertext and then the unkeyed
    Layer 4, and look for coincidences in the DES blocks of the
    resulting block. A key which suggests such a collision we call
    a "collision candidate".</p>

    
<p> Most collision candidates (all but one in 2^16) will be
    false positives. We can test whether a candidate is genuine by
    using it to decrypt all the other ciphertexts; if it is the
    genuine key then it's likely to suggest a collision in another
    block as well. Most likely, after exhaustive search of the
    keyspace for the Layer 5 key, the first block will turn out not
    to contain a collision that suggests the genuine key; we
    discard it and move onto the next one.</p>

    
<p> Expressed in a C-like pseudocode:</p>

<pre>
    int candidate(key, i) {
        return contains_coincidence(untran(decrypt(key, ctext[i])));
    }
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 127; i++) {
        for (key = 0; key &lt; 2^56; key++) {
            if (candidate(key, i)) {
                /* This block is hit on average 2^11 times per i 
                 * Try some other blocks to check for false positives */
                for (j = i + 1; j &lt; 128; j++) {
                    if (candidate(key, j)) {
                        /* Found it */
                        return key;
                    }
                }
                /* Just another false positive, try again */
            }
        }
    }
    
</pre>

    
<p> On average we will discard around 2^5 pairs in this way
    before finding one with a collision that suggests the genuine
    key to find one containing a collision; each test involves 2^56
    * 2^10 trial decryptions, so the overall cost of finding the
    Layer 3 key is around 2^71 trials. Discarding false positives
    takes 2^16 * 128 * 2^10 = 2^33 extra work.</p>

    
<p> This cost dwarfs the cost of finding the other two keys
    once this is done. We exhaustively search for the Layer 1 key
    by looking for a key which generates the Layer 3 input
    collisions corresponding to our output collision; these trials
    are much cheaper since every plaintext input block is the same,
    so the expected cost is 2^55 trials. Then a further 2^55 trials
    will find the Layer 3 key by normal means.</p>

    
<p> This certainly lends weight to the general conclusion that
    inner chaining usually leads to a weaker cipher, but this
    conclusion isn't as useful as it could be in a world that needs
    but doesn't have widely trusted large block ciphers. The
    significance I read from this attack is that large block
    ciphers tend to be vulnerable to plaintexts with special
    structures, and so any secure large block cipher will almost
    certainly have good whitening of both plaintext and ciphertext
    despite the expense, which is something the <a href="../mercy/">Mercy paper</a> anticipated (see <a href="../mercy/html/design_of_mercy.html#SECTION00057000000000000000">
     Section 5.7: Whitening</a> of the HTML version).</p>

    
<p> Thanks to both <a href="http://world.std.com/~cme/">Carl
    Ellison</a> and <a href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/">
    David Wagner</a> for discussion and clarification of this
    attack.</p>
