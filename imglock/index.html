<h1>Image locking</h1>
    
<p>If you're reading this, it's probably because you saw an image
      like that below:</p>

    
<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="imglock.png"></p>

    
<p>This was probably because a site outside <a href="../">ciphergoth.org</a> included an image from this site in
    its own content.  I'd rather people didn't do that without asking
    - if they share images from this site with visitors, I'd rather
    that they were directed to this site so that the images are placed
    in their proper context.  So I've configured the web server to
    replace all such images with the one above.</p>

    
<p>To see the image as it originally was, right-click on it and
    select "Open image" (or similar command).  Then reload.  The
    "IMAGE DENIED" image should be replaced with that originally
    linked.</p>

    
<p>
<strong>Please inform the webmaster of the other site that
	these images no longer work</strong>; hopefullly, this will
      encourage them to get in touch with me to sort it out.</p>

    
<p>If you run another website, and you want to include an image
      from ciphergoth.org, ask me - it's likely we can work something
      out.  If you see other images on this site looking like that
      above, try reloading; if that fails, contact me.  Thanks!</p>
