      I've been taking tons of photos since I got my new digital
      camera.  They aren't any good, but they might look like some
      people you know.  They look like some people I know too, but in
      many cases the resemblance doesn't help me pin a name to a face,
      despite having chatted to them all evening/known them for
      years/slain their firstborn.  At first, I thought about filling in 
      the names I knew and leaving the others blank, but this plan means 
      telling people which ones I know and which ones I don't.
    </p>
    
<p>
      So, now I have an alternative plan: you can tell me who's who.
      I've left all the photos with default titles for now, even the
      ones of me, and underneath each photo is a little box asking
      "who's in this photo?".  You can fill it in with names or just
      rude comments, and when you press the "Tell me" button, your
      browser will swiftly dispatch your immortal words to me by
      email, along with a record of which picture you were commenting
      on.  That way, even if I don't find out the names of any of the
      people I don't know, I at least get some amusing content for the 
      Web pages.
    </p>
    
<p>
      The <a href="../software/gallerific/">rather ingenious bit of
      Perl</a> I used to generate these pages is available for
      download.  You won't be able to make this work for you unless
      you're a fairly experienced Perl programmer, and you're running
      a Unix system with the netpbm tools installed.
