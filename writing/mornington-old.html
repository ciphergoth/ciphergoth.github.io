    <p> OK, so your favourite newsgroup or mailing list has become
    infected with people listing seemingly random London
    Underground stations, each annotated with justification to a
    rule that no-one's mentioned before. They're playing some sort
    of game! But oddly enough, they can't tell you where you can
    find a copy of the rules. And you've done a search for the
    rules, but with no success - you seemed close one time, but
    ended up on a 404. Hopefully, you also found this page.</p>

    
<p> The reason you didn't succeed is the obvious one. <strong>
    <em>There are no rules to Mornington Crescent</em></strong>.
    The whole thing is an elaborate wind-up, a form of trolling
    which for some reason has become socically acceptable. It
    started decades ago with the BBC Radio 4 game show "I'm Sorry,
    I Haven't a Clue", and the whole tedious dross has just
    lumbered on for decades, seemingly without anyone noticing how
    dull and unfunny it's become.</p>

    
<p> Of course, if you assert this on your infected mailing
    list, it'll be denied. Of course there are rules! Try asking in
    alt.fan.mornington-crescent. Or just watch the game being
    played for a bit, you'll pick them up! None of these angry
    denials will be accompanied by working URLs pointing to clear
    descriptions of the rules that account for the game you've seen
    played.</p>

    
<p> Now, it's clear that this assertion does not stand to
    reason: first, because the myriad of strange exceptions being
    quoted would seem to indicate that the rules are way too
    complex to pick up, and second because it's pretty much
    unimaginable that any game so popular on the Internet should
    lack an easily-found Web page which gives a clear explanation
    of what the rules are, especially when you come to wonder how
    everyone <em>else</em> found out about the Einstein/Tchaikovsky
    rule of 1963 regarding Fenchurch St. However, <em>there's an
    easier way to challenge the whole nonsense</em>. Take part for
    a turn! Just post your own move ("New Cross Gate", say),
    complete with spurious justification ("I would have preferred
    to move to St. Paul's, but we had Morden three turns ago so it
    would have been in breach of the slipping rule...") and watch
    what happens.</p>

    
<p> What happens? Nothing! No-one will say "Eh? The slipping
    rule doesn't say that, it says...". Not a one of these rules
    experts will notice that you're making it up from whole cloth.
    If you manage to sound convincing - and of course, if you
    differ sufficiently from the example given here - your
    invention will sit happily with all the other inventions you're
    witnessing. However, when it's clear you're not going to be
    gainsaid, <em>you still have a sacred duty</em>. Tempting as it
    is to sit back and savour the thrill of being in a clique you
    previously felt the chill of being cut out of, it's best to
    abolish the clique altogether. After a couple of days, you
    should reveal exactly what you've done and why, with a pointer
    to this web page, to help put a stop to this nonsense.</p>

    
<p> In doing this, you'll be breaking one of the few great
    taboos of the Internet. Few things are taboo on the internet;
    in most discussion groups it's perfectly reasonable to discuss,
    for example, sodomizing newborns with pitchforks. But reveal
    that there are no rules to Mornington Crescent, and people get
    quite peeved, especially if you make it hard to deny as you
    will have done. Nevertheless, you must do it. Ridding the Net
    of this obnoxious cliquery will not make you popular, but it
    might make it a friendlier and less boring place to be.</p>

    
<p> 
<em>Postscript: bizarrely, a <a href="http://www.the-anathema.org/morning/">rebuttal</a> has
    already gone online barely hours after writing this - arguing
    not that there are rules, but essentially that the rulelessness
    should not be revealed. I disagree, but, well, judge for
    yourself.</em>
