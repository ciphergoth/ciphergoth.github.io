<h1>There are no rules to Mornington Crescent</h1>

<p> So your favourite newsgroup or mailing list has become
    infected with people listing seemingly random London
    Underground stations, each annotated with justification to a
    rule that no-one's mentioned before. They're playing some sort
    of game! But oddly enough, they can't tell you where you can
    find a copy of the rules. And you've done a search for the
    rules, but with no success - you seemed close one time, but
    ended up on a 404. Hopefully, you also found this page.</p>

    
<p> The reason you didn't succeed is the obvious one. <strong>
    <em>There are no rules to Mornington Crescent</em></strong>.
    That is to say, there is no shared rulebook from which the
    rules people quote are drawn. It's all improvised as the
    players go along, and has been since the game was invented for
    the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game "I'm Sorry, I Haven't a Clue"
    many decades ago. In that tradition, it is a harmless bit of
    surrealist improvisational comedy that draws on the poetry of
    London Underground station names (from "Fairlop" to "Mudchute")
    and the shared experience of arguing over the rules of
    too-complex boardgames on Christmas Day. But it has long been a
    tradition that players must never admit that this is what's
    really going on - the usual answer when asked is "oh, just
    watch us play for a while, you'll pick the rules up".</p>

    
<p> Unfortunately, this tradition appeals to the cliquery of
    some insecure people in a very obnoxious way. Lacking the comic
    talent of a Willie Rushton or Graeme Garden, for them the main
    appeal of the game becomes the feeling of superiority over
    those who are seeing the game played for the first time, and
    the warm feeling of being in the clique that knows the secret.
    For them, Mornington Crescent is no more than a socially
    acceptable form of trolling.</p>

    
<p> Some of these players will even go so far as to insist,
    even in private email, that the rules being quoted are real
    rules drawn from a real shared rulebook that the original Radio
    4 players used; they do this mainly in the hope of keeping you
    out of the clique and thereby demonstrating their superiority
    over you in some insignificant matter. It's clear that this
    assertion does not stand to reason: first, because the myriad
    of strange exceptions being quoted would seem to indicate that
    the rules are way too complex to pick up, and second because
    it's pretty much unimaginable that any game so popular on the
    Internet should lack an easily-found Web page which gives a
    clear explanation of what the rules are, especially when you
    come to wonder how everyone <em>else</em> found out about the
    Einstein/Tchaikovsky rule of 1963 regarding Fenchurch St.</p>

    
<p> However, if you really want to convince yourself, the
    easiest way is to make a move in the true spirit of the game.
    Don't feel constrained to London Underground Stations, so long
    as you can come up with a justification. For example, ever
    since the Gardener "cheese" gambit of '84 was ruled legal a
    move such as "Shirokane-Takanawa" (on both the Mita and Nanboku
    lines of the Tokyo Subway) would be perfectly legitimate so
    long as the previous move was to a Northern Line station with a
    "k" in the name. Or move to Milan Kundera's "The Unbearable
    Lightness of Being" - with Parliament suspended for the General
    Election, the "penumbra" rule takes on a whole new meaning!
    Alternatively still, quibble with someone else's move - point
    out that they didn't declare blanket on their previous move so
    they can hardly move to a rail interchange station now.</p>

    
<p> The more surreal the better, and for three reasons. First,
    because the fact that no-one balks at the surreality of your
    move, or the utter fabrication of the rule that justifies it,
    should surely be the best testimony to the nonexistance of any
    rulebook. Second, because the only real rule is that you can do
    what you like, so long as you're witty with it. But third,
    because it will make it far easier for onlookers to pick up on
    what the rules really are, and thus kill off the "clique-style"
    playing which otherwise tends to dominate; to that end, you are
    also duty-bound to pass on the URL for this article to anyone
    else you see enquiring about the rules, even if only in private
    email.</p>

    
<p> In writing this, I'm breaking a taboo on explicitly
    mentioning this aspect of the game. I'm sorry if this spoils
    the fun of the honest players. But I get so incensed by the
    rudeness of those who play to laugh at the uninitiated that I
    think the world needs some easily-found, straightforwardly
    worded resource by which all can become enlightened.</p>
