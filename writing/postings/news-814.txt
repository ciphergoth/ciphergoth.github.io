My friend just described this as the "dictionary attack", which has a
rather different meaning when applied to Usenet ripostes than to
cryptology...

#### reclaim vt. 1. make fit for cultivation 2. bring back 3. reform
#### 4. demand the return of

... so I think we're having meanings 3 and 4 for a main course, with a
side order of 1, and 2 for dessert.

Reclaiming these words is useful because their *sole* insulting
content, really, is that the thing described is bad: whether the word
is queer, slut, pervert - the content is "You fit category X.  And
that's bad."  Reclaiming them is to say "Yes, we do fit that
category.  And that's not bad.  Tough."

Also, there aren't any positive or neutral words for "person who likes
sleeping with new people" waiting out there that we can take up
instead.  We could make up new ones ourselves, but I think overall
that would aid comprehension less than taking up the existing ones and 
challenging the values people attach to them.

Obviously not all poly people are sluts, but unsurprisingly poly
people are less likely to have a bad attitude about those of us who
are.

I hope some of this helps clarify things...
