It sounds from your description as if you're drawing an entirely
appropriate line *in practice*, but your description of it says
something about "drugs" which serves only to muddy the waters.  It
seems to me there are four cases:

A: Unsafe players who haven't taken drugs - will be stopped

B: Safe players who haven't taken drugs - can continue

C: Unsafe players who have taken drugs - will be stopped

D: Safe players who have taken drugs - can in practice continue, since 
you can't tell.

Clearly, this policy is best described without reference to drugs.  If 
you're playing safely, you can go ahead.  If you're playing unsafely,
it doesn't matter whether it's because you're off your head, because
you've had a bad day or because you're just plain careless - the club
will intervene.

A policy is something like a computer program, in that it's intended
to be a description of an algorithm, in this case an algorithm by
which other people can make better guesses about when you'll
intervene, so that you can be seen to be fair.  Good policy design
shares some traits with good computer programming: predictable
outcomes, generality, and clean design. The applicable maxim here is:
"a designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing
left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
