I think it's a little more complex than that.  First, I get the
impression that UK goths are less serious and more varied - there's a
gathering of a thousand goths in Whitby every year, it's gone full-out
for the cheezy, taking-the-piss themes like the Spice Girls (including
popular pink "Spice Goth" T-shirts), and the person who suggested
turning up in silver lame would fit right in.  "Pink is the New Black"...

Secondly, the fear and distrust that gatherings of goths sometimes
display on seeing people with no outward signs of non-normality are to 
some extent a learned reaction: a decent proportion of such people who
come up to you on the street, or visit the goth floor of the local
club from the other floors, want to know: are you're a boy or a girl,
are you gay, why do you make yourself look like that?  Random
strangers giving goths a hard time happens just often enough that we
think "I must try harder to avoid confrontation next time around", and 
sometimes that ends up meaning "In future I'll avoid strangers who
don't fit in".

I'll confess straight away to being something of an identikit goth
myself - I've never displayed great imagination in the clothing
department and I rely on my Fashion Advisor to guide me.  But some of
the goths are *very* original and it would be hard to point at any
common feature of the clothing at a big goth event that might be a
badge of belonging toa group.
