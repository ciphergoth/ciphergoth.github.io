Could be.

But the style of Geraldo's show is such that it simply will not be
shown unless they can get a sufficiently gory edit on it.  Pressure on
them to show it will surely cause them to go over the tape again to
see if they can find such an edit.

This is your fundamental mistake; I'll come to discussing it in a
moment.

Aside: I don't think the sexism in the phrase "it takes a man to build
one" can be excised; you need a new phrase.  You'll also annoy lots of
TG people if you imply that they're neither men nor women...

It would surely be a bad idea to give our help on ventures whose
wisdom we question?

No, I think you're seeing what isn't there.  I don't think anyone
actually thinks that Brett is actually stupid, like in some way
incapable of following complex trains of thought.  People are just
saying that he made a mistake, which anyone can make.

I'm disturbed that no-one is arguing that getting this Geraldo shown
would actually be a good idea; instead all we've seen is criticism for
daring to criticise what an Activist has done.

It is a very common attitude that you shouldn't criticise what
activists do because they're doing it and you're not, and it's a big
mistake.  The whole point about activism is that it's supposed to be
directed at a goal affecting more people than just yourself, so it
makes sense to ask for the intellectual input of others on what you're
doing.  Here's a lot of people saying "we're worried that showing this
episode of Geraldo will damage our shared long-term interests", and
you're saying that we should try to get it shown anyway because
Brett's sincere and has done all this work.  It seems to me that
stifling debate on what actually is in our long term interests and
blindly following the leaders would be madness.
