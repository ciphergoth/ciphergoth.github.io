Neither; the arithmetic is done in the field GF(2^8).  In this field,
addition is just XOR ("^"), and multiplication looks like this:

uint32 gf8_mul(
    uint32 a,
    uint32 b,
    uint32 m
) 
{
    uint32 res = 0;

    while (b != 0) {
        if (b & 1) {
            res ^= a;
        }
        b >>= 1;
        a <<= 1;
        if (a & 0x100) {
            a ^= m;
        }
    }
    return res;
}

The third parameter "m" represents the polynomial defining the field.
The MDS matrix uses this value:

#define MDS_POLYNOMIAL ((1<<8)|(1<<6)|(1<<5)|(1<<3)|(1<<0))

and the RS matrix this value:

#define RS_POLYNOMIAL ((1<<8)|(1<<6)|(1<<3)|(1<<2)|(1<<0))

Hope this helps,
