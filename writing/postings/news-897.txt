You seem to think that being polite is someone else's job.  In fact,
it's everyone's job to be polite if intelligent debate is to be
furthered.  It's not hard to work out that this was uncalled for.

The Scotsman covered a Scottish fetish club a while ago, and I know
the Guardian has covered bisexuality quite a few times.  

What I'd really like to see is an article with a better spin than
"these fantastically wacky people are perfectly prosaic really".  I
know that if I were to appear in such an article, it would be "By day,
Paul Crowley is a computer programmer, but by night, he dresses up in
women's clothing and enters the fantasy world of the fetish club".
None of this would be untrue, but the impression it leaves is wholly
inaccurate.  I can't stand the "SM=fantasy dreamland,
computers=prosaic real world" attitude: computers are the biggest
fantasy dreamland ever imagined, housing extraordinary virtual
constructs with only tenuous links to physical reality, while SM sex
is something I really do, in real life, with people who are physically
present.  I'm not leading any kind of dual life: both my enjoyment of
SM sex and my fascination with making computers do interesting stuff
are real, integrated parts of who I am all the time, day and night.

Unfortunately, that's generally the spin the *quality* press want to
put on us; worse, they think it's tolerant.

(irrelevant thinks: I wonder if you could work out a scene based on
the world of "Tron"?  They all wear skintight outfits...)

How many new fetish clubs a year are there?  It wouldn't be
impractical for us to send a press advice pack to every single one,
especially since it won't be long before they're all online.

No, I don't see what you mean.  And keeping the debate reasonable and
useful is everyone's job, including yours.
