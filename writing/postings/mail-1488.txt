Another good resource for information about the Mindcraft tests is
Linux Weekly News, http://lwn.net/

Note that while the report is full of deceptions and misdirections,
there's at least one clear, bald-faced lie which can be established
beyond doubt.  Weiner claims in the report to have asked for help with
configuring Linux in more than one "appropriate forum". However, all
of the appropriate forums are archived, and some people did a lot of
searching and found only one request for help, which immediately
elicited requests for clarification that were never forthcoming.

Weiner's written quite a bit in answer to critics of the report, but
he's curiously never deigned to respond to the commonly-levelled
accusation of outright lying even though one or two URLs pointing to
an archived request for help such as he described in the report would
settle the matter.  I conclude therefore that this bit of text was an
outright and deliberate falsehood intended to tarnish the reputation
of the Linux community.

Because this is so cut-and-dried - quote the relevant part of the
report, challenge him to quote the URLs - this is all Linus Torvalds,
Jeremy Allison, or anyone else need cite as a reason why they don't
intend to have their names attached to yet another exercise in
bald-faced lying.
