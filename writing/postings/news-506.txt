You're still arguing as if there were a labour shortage and we needed
all hands on deck.  There isn't, and this whole nonsense is a rather
weak attempt to blame unemployment on the unemployed.

May I suggest that those of us still bothering to argue with this
thread designate this GRH Response 1, or GRH-R1 for short?  It'll save
us typing it out in full every time we need to make this point.

But you accidentally raise an interesting point.  Some places won't
allow you to wear any symbol or slogan advocating a hotly contested
point of view.  However, frequently their definition of "hotly
contested" ends up bolstering the media's attempts to distort our
picture of what is widely believed: for example, you'll be allowed to
wear a "Scotland Against Drugs" badge in Sainsbury's, but wear a
"Scotland Against Drugs Hypocrisy" badge and your supervisor will want
a word with you.  Thus it would be easy to get the impression that the
majority of people who hold down steady jobs are either in favour of
drug prohibition or neutral on the subject, whereas it could just as
easily be the case that every other cashier goes raving every
fortnight.
