Ever wanted to know what multiple relationships are really like?  How
they succeed, how they fail, what the people in them get out of them
and how they keep them going?  Now you can find out!

People of all varieties of polyamorous relationships have joined this
newsgroup to discuss their experiences, their thoughts, and their
feelings about this unusual way of living.  You can learn about the
things you're curious about with this simple guideline:

*DON'T BLOODY DRIVE US AWAY WITH YOUR DAMN QUESTIONS!*

Sorry to be rude, but it needed to be said.  A great many people
posting are not poly and would like to know more about it.  This truly 
is a good opportunity for those people to find out what they want to
know, but posting questions is not a good method!  Mostly, we've come
here to discuss these things with other poly people, not to appear on
some sort of 24-hour phone-in chat show; if we find that to be the
mood of the newsgroup, we'll all just leave, and no-one will gain.

Let me recommend instead spending some time simply sitting back and
watching where the discussion goes: there's lots of fascinating things 
to discuss and I'm sure they'll all come up before too long.

cheers,
