<h1>Assorted postings to newsgroups</h1>
    
<p> These Web pages are not very informative about me or what I
    think. The <em>good</em> solution to this problem is to
    actually write some content, but that would take far too long,
    and I'm eager to use my cunning Web page upload system. So
    instead I've trawled through my huge lists of postings to
    mailing lists and newsgroups and picked out a few articles that
    might actually have been worth writing, and then assembled them
    here in mostly random order. Enjoy.</p>

    
<p> Most of the articles here are really old. I'd like to do a
    thorough update in my Copious Free Time...</p>
