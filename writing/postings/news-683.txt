I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to ask her about this
when she spoke in London at Skin Two's "Aural Sex" day.

It seems to me that the term is used to conflate the two: non-BDSMers
and non-BDSM sex at one end of the scale, and "Daily Mail" Ann
Widdicombe Middle England at the other.  I don't think it's polite to
tell the shaved, pierced bisexual guy who helps out at the local
fetish club that because he's not himself into BDSM, he's vanilla, and 
therefore he's Ann Widdicombe.

In general, I'm not at all convinced that it's a good idea to have a
name for the group of people who aren't you, just because some of
those people have a bad attitude about you, and that's true whether
the word is vanilla, goyim, or mundane.
