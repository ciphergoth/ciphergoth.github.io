I don't think relying on the error propogation properties of block
ciphers for integrity is a good idea.  For example, it might under
some circumstances serve an attacker to turn 128 bytes of the message
to unpredictable noise, if the format of the original message had the
right shape.  It might for example be the case that the amount
transferred into your account is expressed as a 32-bit word, in which
case a random value is likely to be higher than the one in the
message; perhaps the other bytes modified are padding bytes or specify 
accounting information that can take any value.  It would be a mistake 
to burden the application designers with making sure their messages
don't have this property; you're better off using a real MAC.

As far as I can tell block ciphers are used far more often than
they are appropriate; the CPU-load of block-cipher based stream
ciphers is quite a bit higher than that of native stream ciphers, and
the benefits seem to be questionable.
