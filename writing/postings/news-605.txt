I think it is a front runner.  15 ciphers were submitted to NIST for
the AES contest:

CAST-256, CRYPTON, DEAL, DFC, E2, FROG, Hasty Pudding, LOKI97, MARS,
MAGENTA, RC6, Rijndael, SAFER+, SERPENT, Twofish.

Of these, four have sufficiently serious results against them to fall
by the wayside: MAGENTA, LOKI97, FROG, and DEAL (I got this from
http://www.ii.uib.no/~larsr/aes.html - the AES sofa in the block
cipher lounge).  For reasons I don't fully understand, the
equivalent-key result against MARS isn't being taken as damning, but
I'll go with the flow here.  This leaves:

CAST-256, CRYPTON, DFC, E2, Hasty Pudding, MARS, RC6, Rijndael,
SAFER+, SERPENT, Twofish.

The rest people seem generally happy with the security, so I'll move
straight onto performance issues.  I've looked in three places for
performance information: CAESAR's performance comparisons, Brian
Gladman's C implementations, and the performance comparison
paper by the Twofish team:
http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/crypto/CAESAR/performances.html
http://www.seven77.demon.co.uk/aes.htm
http://www.counterpane.com/twofish/

CAESAR's comparisons on the target Pentium Pro processor make it clear
we can forget about DEAL and SAFER+ on performance grounds: they don't
seem to have advantages over the other candidates that justify paying
that huge performance price.  DEAL went earlier anyway on security
grounds. Hasty Pudding and DFC also look a little dodgy here but I'll
let them through.  This leaves:

CAST-256, CRYPTON, DFC, E2, Hasty Pudding, MARS, RC6, Rijndael,
SERPENT, Twofish.

Now time for the real cull: smart card memory requirements.  These
figures are taken from the Counterpane paper, but they're backed up by
figures from the original paper and close argument and I'd be
interested to hear about any problems with them.  Seven of the
algorithms (CAST-256, Crypton, DEAL, Rijndael, SAFER+, Serpent,
Twofish) require 60 bytes of memory or less.  The remaining algorithms
either require at least 195 bytes (DFC, E2, Frog, MARS, RC6), or do
not discuss this requirement in the presentation papers (HPC, Loki97,
Magenta) - it seems that HPC at least would require 2K of key tables.
This leaves only:

CAST-256, Crypton, Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish

Two very popular candidates just got dropped: MARS and RC6.  Schneier
et al argue that while their key setup requirements might fit into a
256-byte CPU, so little memory would be left (no more than 61 bytes)
that no practical application could use them.  They do look very
impressive on high-end processors, and I hope the inventors decide to
release the patents so we can use them on such applications, but the
AES winner has to be flexible enough to run in a wider variety of
environments.  Again, I'm interested to hear counterarguments, since
this is controversial.

This gives us five front runners.  Here are Schneier et al's figures
on their performance:

CAST-256 Crypton Rijndael Serpent Twofish
    4300     360     2100    2500    8000  Key setup PPro in C
     660     480      440    1030     400  Encrypt PPro in C
     600     390      320     900     285  Encrypt PPro in ASM
     600     390      320    1100     290  Encrypt Pentium in ASM
(Figures in clocks from Table 2 of the Schneier et. al. paper.
Note that faster ASM versions of Twofish have been developed since
this came out.)

My eyes hurt, so I'm not going to try and summarise the results on the 
CAESER or Brian Gladman pages; I encourage you to go and look. I don't 
think that CAST or Serpent have enough to recommend them to justify
the performance cost; this basically leaves Crypton, Rijndael, and
Twofish as likely winners.  I find through writing this that I haven't 
been paying enough attention to Crypton in this contest and I'll have
to find out more about it - Schneier et al say it's the most hardware
friendly.  Rijndael is rather nice.  However, I agree with the
previous poster that Twofish is the most likely contest winner - it's
the best performer on 32-bit processors, very competitive everywhere
else, and offers a wide variety of useful implementation tradeoffs.
It also has the most comprehensive submission document.
