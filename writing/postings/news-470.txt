No one.  Newsgroups are based on trust; it's almost impossible to
prevent people posting inappropriate stuff to them in the same way we
can't prevent people pissing in the public swimming pools.  If you're
used to finding the limits of what's done by looking to Authority,
you'll have to think again; for the most part, the limits here are set
by charter, tradition, and ultimately politeness.

If you post something which nearly everyone in the newsgroup thinks
was wrong to post, it probably was.  This doesn't mean that we can
*prevent* those wrong postings, but illicit is not the same as wrong.

This is the answer to "you dare to criticise something I've done?  WHO
DIED AND MADE YOU GOD?????!!!!!????".  Our voices each have weight
because we are participants in the newsgroup.
