"Why do you feel the need to go around telling people you're bisexual?
I don't go around telling people I'm straight."

Well, no, it would be like telling people it's not your birthday.  You
might tell people you're straight if you met them at Pride, or at
Bicon, but under most circumstances most people will assume you're
straight unless you tell them otherwise.

There's no symmetry here, and no analogy.  Maybe if you're hetero and
you usually go to Pride and otherwise hang out with a mostly queer
scene you might have some limited experience of having to tell people
that your sexuality is not what they assumed it was, but if you do
then you'll probably have a good idea of how limited that similarity
is.

"Why should it matter to me what you do in bed?"

Bisexuality isn't just about what you do in bed.  It should be, but it
isn't.  It's a break in a chain of assumptions that the people you
organise your life with are the people you fall in love with, and the
people you fall in love with are the people you want to have sex with,
and the people you want to have sex with are the other sex to you. 

I'd like to see the chain break at every link, but it's a long
explanation to give to someone you've just met at a goth club.  At the
very least, though, I'd like to feel free to talk about partners of
both genders to such people without them thinking I'm "shoving my
sexuality down their throat" (they wish!) - should I have to actually
pretend to be straight in order not to disturb the normal flow of
conversation?

The other think that makes it more than what we do in bed is the
straightforward bigotry we sometimes face.  Am I allowed to mention the
job I had to leave because the management wanted to fire me for being
a "pervert"?  (they didn't know one quarter of the half of it!)  How
about the people who disguise parts of their lives for the benefit of
their parents, may they talk about that?

You may protest that all of these things would be in context; it's my
experience that people retell stories in which people came out to them
as though it was out of context even when the person they were talking
to would have had a hard time *not* mentioning their sexuality at that
point in the conversation without being downright misleading.

The people who really do mention it out of context tend to be the
people who are newly out, and frankly, all power to them.  Most people
who haven't had to do it underestimate the work and mental hassle
they've had to do before being able to tell random people in clubs
about their sexuality, and the simple fact of their success is one of
the most important things in their lives to them at that point.  It
won't kill you to let them exercise it without slagging them off
behind their backs from the comfort of a mainstream accepted
sexuality.
