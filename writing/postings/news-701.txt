I think I take the "atheism" tag and run with it further than most
people are prepared to.  Strictly, "agnostic" means that you believe
that the matter of God's existance is unknowable, so I'm definitely an 
agnostic.  I'm also an atheist: there's a big difference between not
believing in the existence of God and actively believing in his
nonexistance, and atheism only implies the former.

However, I do *not* have an open mind [1].  It's not just that the
evidence points against the existence of God, it's that God is an
infinitely complex "hypothesis" with no predictive power, so *no*
evidence would be sufficient to weight things in His favour.  For
example, if the heavens were to open and a huge shining bearded face
were to appear, saying "Look, my son, I exist, what more do you want?"
then I think that God's existence would not be the explanation to
reach for.
